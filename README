    XML::XPathBuilder - Build path which for the XPath

SYNOPSIS
      use XML::XPathBuilder;
      my $builder = XML::XPathBuilder->new;

      $buider->find("//foo")->include("bar")->find("baz");

DESCRIPTION
    The jQeury remembers a context in the DOM. XPath can the same? i want
    it.

    i love XPath, but it has long path when doing a bit challenging way.

    i learned XPath can //foo[.="bar"]/../baz, but it is difficult to write
    to my template engine.

        paths. After cleaning, set a path which is argument to the paths.

    include( $string )
        Adds a path to the paths, but has a bit modification that changes
        word to XPath's word.

    eq( $number )
        Selects a element which appears in $number order.
